Manage a VM resource within Netbox.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_virtualization_vm" "vm_test" {
  name       = "TestVm"
  comments   = "VM created by terraform"
  vcpus      = "2.00"
  disk       = 50
  memory     = 16
  cluster_id = 1
  local_context_data = jsonencode(
    {
      hello  = "world"
      number = 1
    }
  )

  tag {
    name = "tag1"
    slug = "tag1"
  }

  custom_field {
    name  = "cf_boolean"
    type  = "boolean"
    value = "true"
  }

  custom_field {
    name  = "cf_date"
    type  = "date"
    value = "2020-12-25"
  }

  custom_field {
    name  = "cf_text"
    type  = "text"
    value = "some text"
  }

  custom_field {

      dictionary = {
        numbervalue = 5
      }
    })
  }

  custom_field {
    name  = "cf_object"
    type  = "object"
    value = data.netbox_dcim_platform.platform_test.id
  }
